    Parallel coordinates are a visualisation technique for multidimensional data, which uses
    parallel axes to represent dimensions and polylines to represent records. A dimension can be
    either numerical or categorical (strings). Each dimension can have its own range and scale, or
    dimensions can be normalised. Each record has a data value on each dimension. Parallel
    coordinates are primarily used for analysis to help identify patterns, trends, correlations, and
    outliers.

    Parallel coordinates were first developed in 1883 by Henry Gannett as part of the Statistical
    Atlas of the United States. In 1885, Maurice d’Ocagne published a mathematical theory of
    parallel coordinates.

    In the computer age, parallel coordinates were popularised by Alfred Inselberg. Inselberg and
    Dimsdale developed PC to help solve complex multidimensional optimisation problems, such as
    collision avoidance for air traffic control. Today, PC are widely used and studied. Siirtola et
    al. conducted an eye tracking study with first-time users of PC visualisations, showing how
    quickly users adapt to this type of visualisation. In another study, Siirtola and Räihä surveyed
    interaction techniques and compared them with the guidelines in the literature, concluding with
    an experiment that using PC performs well. Johansson et al. studied users’ skill at recognising
