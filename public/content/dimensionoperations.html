<h2>Operations on Dimensions</h2>

<ul>

<li><span class="liheading">Inverting Dimensions</span>
<p class="litext">
By default, a dimension’s axis places higher values at the top and lower 
values at the bottom. Inverting a dimension can be helpful to corroborate a 
suspected correlation between adjacent dimensions.
</p>

<p class="liinstruction">Clicking the arrow above the dimension axis or using 
the dimension's context menu inverts the dimension.</p>
</li>
<li><span class="liheading">Moving Dimensions</span>
<p class="litext">
When looking for correlations between dimensions, meaningful relationships 
are only revealed between adjacent dimensions. Hence, it is important to be 
able to move one dimension next to another dimension of interest.
</p>

<p class="liinstruction">With drag and drop a dimension can be moved at the 
desired position.</p>
</li>
<li><span class="liheading">Hiding Dimensions</span>

<p class="litext">
Displaying too many dimensions can be overwhelming, so it is important to 
be able to hide individual dimensions.
</p>

<p class="liinstruction">A dimension can be hidden and shown within the 
dimension's context menu.</p>
</li>
<li><span class="liheading">Adjusting a Dimension's Range</span>

<p class="litext">
By default, the range of the dimension’s axis is set to the minimum 
and maximum values present in the current dataset.
</p>

<p class="liinstruction">To adjust the range of a dimension select one of three 
options in the dimension's context menu.</p>
</li>
</ul>
