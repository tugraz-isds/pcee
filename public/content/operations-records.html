<h2>3. Operations on Records</h2>

<p>
Interactivity brings a parallel coordinates chart to life.
Some interactive operations relate to records:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="liheading">Filtering Records</span>
<p>
Records can be activated and deactivated by setting filters on one or more 
dimensions. Records outside of the range are automatically deactivated and 
greyed out.
</p>
<p class="liinstruction">Use the double-edged range sliders <svg width="18" height="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 4 11" style="vertical-align:middle;">
  <path fill="rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.7)" stroke="black" stroke-width="0.05" d="M 0.5 2 L 2 4 L 3.5 2 z"/>
  <path fill="rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.7)" stroke="black" stroke-width="0.02" d="M 1.5 4.05 L 2.5 4.05 L 2.5 6.5 L 1.5 6.5 z" />
  <path fill="none" stroke ="black" stroke-width="0.05" d="M 2 4 L 2 6.5 z" />
  <path fill="rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.7)" stroke="black" stroke-width="0.05" d="M 0.5 8.5 L 2 6.5 L 3.5 8.5 z"/>
</svg> to filter out 
some records. Filters can also be set by right-clicking on a dimension's
name to open its context menu.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="liheading">Selecting Records</span>
<p>
It is helpful to be able to select one or more records in the dataset
and to highlight them accordingly.
</p>
<p class="liinstruction">Click left on one or more polylines to highlight
them in orange. A shift-left-click adds one or more records to the current
selection. Left-clicking in empty space clears the current selection.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="liheading">Hovering over Records</span>
<p>
If there are a large number of records, a parallel coordinates visualisation 
contains a large number of potentially crossing and overlapping polylines, so 
it is challenging to recognise which polyline belongs to which record.
</p>
<p class="liinstruction">Hover over one or more polylines to highlight the
polyline(s) beneath the mouse pointer in red and to get tooltips with the
label(s) of the corresponding record(s).</p>
</li>

</ul>
