<h2>3. Operations on Records</h2>

<p>
Interactivity brings a parallel coordinates chart to life.
Some interactive operations relate to records:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="liheading">Filtering Records</span>
<p>
Records can be activated and deactivated by setting filters on one or more 
dimensions. Records outside of the range are automatically deactivated and 
greyed out.
</p>
<p class="liinstruction">
Use the double-edged range sliders to filter out some records. Filters
can also be set by right-clicking on a dimension's name to
open its context menu.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="liheading">Selecting Records</span>
<p>
It is helpful to be able to select one or more records in the dataset
and to highlight them accordingly.
</p>
<p class="liinstruction">
Click left on one or more polylines to highlight them in orange. A
shift-left-click adds one or more records to the current
selection. Left-clicking in empty space clears the current
selection.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="liheading">Hovering over Records</span>
<p>
If there are a large number of records, a parallel coordinates visualisation 
contains a large number of potentially crossing and overlapping polylines, so 
it is challenging to recognise which polyline belongs to which record.
</p>
<p class="liinstruction">
Hover over one or more polylines to highlight the polyline(s) beneath
the mouse pointer in red and to get tooltips with the label(s) of the
corresponding record(s).</p>
</li>

</ul>
