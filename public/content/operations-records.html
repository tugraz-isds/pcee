<h2>3. Operations on Records</h2>

<p>
Interactivity brings a parallel coordinates chart to life.
Some interactive operations relate to records:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="liheading">Filtering Records</span>
<p class="litext">
Records can be activated and deactivated by setting filters on one or more 
dimensions. Records outside of the range are automatically deactivated and 
greyed out.
</p>
<p class="liinstruction">Use the double-edged range sliders to
filter out some records. Filters can also be set from a dimension's
context menu.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="liheading">Selecting Records</span>
<p class="litext">It is helpful to be able to select one or more records in the 
dataset and to highlight them accordingly.
</p>
<p class="liinstruction">Click left on one or more polylines to highlight
them in orange. A shift-left-click adds one or more records to the current selection. Left-clicking in empty space clears the current selection.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="liheading">Hovering over Records</span>
<p class="litext">
If there are a large number of records, a parallel coordinates visualisation 
contains a large number of potentially crossing and overlapping polylines, so 
it is challenging to recognise which polyline belongs to which record.
</p>
<p class="liinstruction">Hover over one or more polylines to highlight the 
polyline(s) beneath the mouse pointer in red and to get tooltips with the 
label(s) of the corresponding record(s).</p>
</li>

</ul>
