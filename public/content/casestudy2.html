<h2>Case Study: Student Marks</h2>

<p>
By using the iteractions described above, several interesting observations can be made within the student marks dataset.
</p>

<h3>Adjusting dimension range</h3>

<p>
With the created parallel coordinates, note that the PE dimension in the plot 
ranges from 50 to 100 (and both History and IT range from 10 to 100). This is 
because, by default, Parallel Coordinates set the viewing range for each 
dimension to match the minimum and maximum values in the dataset, sometimes 
rounding up or down. In this case, each student is awarded between 0 and 100 
points in each subject. However, in PE, no students were awarded less than 51 
or higher than 99 points. For this particular dataset, it would make sense to 
show the range of each subject dimension from 0 to 100 since that would be more 
consistent and better represent the original data domain.

<h3>Select record</h3>

<p>
Exploring the records, one noticeable feature is that all students have 50 or 
better in PE. There is also one student who is performing particularly badly in 
Art compared to the other students. Selecting this student reveals her to 
be student Sylvia.

<h3>Filter records</h3>

<p> 
Another technique to explore a dataset is to filter out records in one 
dimension, and seeing how those changes are reflected in other dimensions. 
</p>

<button class="usage-button" id="filter-button">English: Filter 50â€“100</button>

<p>
For example, records with scores lower than 50 in the dimension English have been filtered out, and it is noticeable that records with scores lower than 50 in the dimension German are analogously filtered out.
</p>

<h3>Move dimension</h3>

<p>
Often, analysts want to directly compare dimensions and look for correlations. 
In order to compare two dimensions, they must be placed next to each other. To test the theory that students who are good in one language also tend to be good in other languages (positive correlation) move German next to English. Straight, almost parallel lines between two dimensions are an indication of a positive correlation. There are not many line crossings between English and German.

<h3>Invert dimension</h3>

<p>
For confirmation, one of the two dimensions can be inverted. A classic cross pattern can be seen, indicating a (now) negative correlation, when English is inverted.
</p>

<p>
This is a good visual confirmation that the two dimensions are, in fact, positively correlated.
