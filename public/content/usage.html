<p><span class="header">Identifying Outliers and Clusters of Records</span><br>

Outliers stand out clearly because their polylines follow a different path to 
those of other records. Clusters are groups of data records which have similar characteristics, so their polylines follow similar paths.</p>

<p><span class="option-header">Example outliers:</span><br>
With the current dataset, there is no obvious outliers to identify. But we can
add one.<br>
<button id="addOutlier">Add outlier</button><br>
What can you observe?
<br>
A: Car G is completely outside the norm and has no similarities with the other cars.

<p><span class="header">Looking for Correlations Between Dimensions</span><br>

If two dimensions are positively correlated, high values in one dimension will 
map to high values in the other, and low values to low values. If low values 
map to high values and vice versa, the two dimensions are negatively correlated.

</p>

<p><span class="option-header">Example negative correlation:</span><br>

<span class=italic>Place weight next to speed!</span><br>
What can you observe?
<br>
A: Cars with higher speeds tend to be lighter than those with lower speeds. 
This suggests that there is a negative correlation between speed and weight.
</p>

<p><span class="option-header">Example positive correlation:</span><br>
<span class=italic>Place price next to speed!</span><br>
What can you observe?
<br>
A: Cars with higher speeds tend to be more expensive than those 
with lower speeds. This indicates a positive correlation between speed and 
price.
