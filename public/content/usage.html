<p><span class="header">Identifying Outliers and Clusters of Records</span><br>

Outliers stand out clearly because their polylines follow a different path to 
those of other records. Clusters are groups of data records which have similar characteristics, so their polylines follow similar paths.</p>

<p><span class="option-header">Example outliers:</span><br>
With the current dataset, there is one obvious outlier to identify.<br>
<button id="showOutlier">Show outlier</button><br>
<br>
Car G is completely outside the norm and has no similarities with the other cars.

<p><span class="header">Looking for Correlations Between Dimensions</span><br>

If two dimensions are positively correlated, high values in one dimension will 
map to high values in the other, and low values to low values. If low values 
map to high values and vice versa, the two dimensions are negatively correlated.

</p>

<p><span class="option-header">Example negative correlation:</span><br>
In the current dataset a negative correlation can be found between speed and
weight.<br>
<button id="showNegativeCorrelation">Show negative correlation</button><br>
<br>
Cars with higher speeds tend to be lighter than those with lower speeds. 
This suggests that there is a negative correlation between speed and weight.
</p>

<p><span class="option-header">Example positive correlation:</span><br>
In the current dataset a positive correlation between speed and weight can be found when one of the dimension is inverted.<br>
<button id="showPositiveCorrelation">Show positive correlation</button><br>
<br>
Cars with higher speeds tend to be more expensive than those 
with lower speeds. This indicates a positive correlation between speed and 
price.
