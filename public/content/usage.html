<h2>Usage</h3>

<p>Parallel coordinates are used for:</p>
    
<ul>
<li>Discovering clusters and outliers.</li>
<li>Find correlations between dimensions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Identifying Outliers and Clusters of Records</h3>

<p>
Outliers stand out clearly because their polylines follow a different path 
to those of other records. Clusters are groups of data records which have 
similar characteristics, so their polylines follow similar paths.
</p>

<h4>Example outliers:</h4>

<p id="paragraph-0">
With the current dataset, there is one obvious outlier to identify.
</p>

<button id="outlier-button">Show outlier</button>

<p>
Patient F stands out as a clear outlier, with:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Significantly higher blood pressure and cholesterol,</li>
<li>Lower heart rate,</li>
<li>High BMI,</li>
<li>Advanced age.</li>
</ul>

<p id="paragraph-0">
This patient could be flagged for potential cardiovascular risk.
</p>

<h3>Looking for Correlations Between Dimensions</h3>

<p id="paragraph-0">
If two dimensions are positively correlated, high values in one dimension will 
map to high values in the other, and low values to low values. If low values 
map to high values and vice versa, the two dimensions are negatively correlated.

<h4>Example for positive and negative correlation:</h4>

<p id="paragraph-0">
In the current dataset a positive correlation can be find between Age and Blood Pressure. By inverting Age a negative correlation is shown.
</p>

<button id="correlation-button">Show negative correlation</button>

<p id="paragraph-0">
Tendentially, Blood Pressure increases with age.
