<h2>Usage</h3>

<p>Parallel coordinates are used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovering clusters and outliers among records.</li>
<li>Finding correlations between dimensions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Identifying Outliers and Clusters of Records</h3>

<p>
Outliers stand out clearly because their polylines follow a different path 
to those of other records. Clusters are groups of data records which have 
similar characteristics, so their polylines follow similar paths.
</p>

<h4>Example Outlier</h4>

<p id="paragraph-0">
The Heart Health Dataset contains one obvious outlier:
</p>

<button class="usage-button" id="outlier-button">Show outlier</button>

<p>
Patient F stands out as a clear outlier, with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>significantly higher blood pressure and cholesterol,</li>
<li>lower heart rate,</li>
<li>high BMI, and</li>
<li>advanced age.</li>
</ul>

<p id="paragraph-0">
This patient could be flagged for potential cardiovascular risk.

<h3>Looking for Correlations Between Dimensions</h3>

<p id="paragraph-0">
If two dimensions are positively correlated, high values in one
dimension correspond to high values in the other. Low values in one
dimension correspond to low values in the other. In a parallel
coordinates plot, this can be seen only when the two dimensions are
adjacent to one another. Parallel, non-crossing straight line segments
run betwen the two dimensions, as shown in Figure X. In a scatterplot,
this corresponds to points falling along straight line, as shown in
Figure Y.

</div>

<p>
If two dimensions are negatively correlated, low values in one
correspond to high values in the other and vice versa. In a parallel
coordinates plot, the line segments between the adjacent dimensions
all cross in the middle, as shown in Figure X. In the equivalent
scatterplot, the points fall along a negatively inclined straight
line, as shown in Figure Y.

<h4>Example of a Positive Correlation</h4>

<p id="paragraph-0">
In the Heart Health Dataset, the dimensions Age and Blood Pressure are
positively correlated. Tendentially, blood pressure increases with
age. With real data, parallel non-crossing line segments are rare. It
often makes sense to invert one of the two dimensions to check for the
visual cross pattern. This can be seen by inverting the Age dimension:
