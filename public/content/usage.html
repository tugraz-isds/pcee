<h2>6. Usage</h2>

<p>
Parallel coordinates are used for identifying outliers and clusters
among records, and discovering correlations between dimensions.
</p>

<h3>6.1 Identifying Outliers Among Records</h3>

<p>
An outlier is a record whose data points differ significantly from
other records in one or more dimensions. Outliers stand out clearly,
because their polylines follow a different path to those of other
records.
</p>

<p>
The Heart Health Dataset contains one obvious outlier, Patient F, with
significantly higher blood pressure and cholesterol, lower heart rate,
high BMI, and advanced age.

<h3>6.2 Identifying Clusters of Records</h3>

<p>
Clusters are groups of data records which have similar
characteristics, so their polylines follow similar paths.

<h3>6.3 Discovering Correlations Between Dimensions</h3>

<p>
If two dimensions are positively correlated, high values in one
dimension correspond to high values in the other. Low values in one
dimension correspond to low values in the other. In a parallel
coordinates chart, this can be seen only when the two dimensions are
adjacent to one another.
</p>
<p>
A perfect positive correlation is characterised by parallel,
non-crossing straight line segments running between the two dimensions,
as shown in Figure <a href="#fig1a">1a</a>. In a scatterplot, this
corresponds to points falling along a straight line, as shown in
Figure <a href="#fig1b">1b</a>. In real life, data is typically
messier, and a positive correlation can be less obvious in parallel
coordinates than in a scatterplot, as shown in
Figures <a href="#fig2a">2a</a> and <a href="#fig2b">2b</a>.

<p>
If two dimensions are negatively correlated, low values in one
correspond to high values in the other and vice versa. A perfect
negative correlation is characterised by line segments between
adjacent dimensions which all cross in the middle, as shown
in Figure <a href="#fig3a">3a</a>. In the equivalent scatterplot, the
points fall along a negatively inclined straight line, as shown
in Figure <a href="#fig3b">3b</a>.

<p>
In the Heart Health Dataset, the dimensions Age and Fitness Score are
negatively correlated. Generally, the fitness score tends to decrease
with increasing age. This can be seen by moving the Fitness Score
dimension next to the Age dimension:

<button class="usage-button" id="correlation-neg-button">Move Fitness Score Dimension</button>
<p class="error" id="move-error"></p>

<p>
In the Heart Health Dataset, the dimensions Age and Blood Pressure are
positively correlated. Tendentially, blood pressure increases with
age. With real data, parallel non-crossing line segments are rare. It
often makes sense to invert one of the two dimensions to check for the
visual cross pattern. This can be seen by inverting the Age dimension:
