A fictitious dataset of student marks, which consists of 30 
rows of data (records), and 9 columns (dimensions), including the name of the 
student. Each row represents one student and their marks between 0 and 100 in 8 
subjects. 
Each dimension, apart from the first, represents one subject. The student marks 
dataset was deliberately curated to contain some interesting outliers and 
correlations. For example, students who are good in English are usually also 
good in German.
