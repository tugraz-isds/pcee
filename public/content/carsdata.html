<p>A dataset which represents different cars, each with varying specifications 
consists of 5 dimensions and 6 records:<p>
    
<ul>
  <li>Speed: The maximum speed of the car in kilometers per hour (km/h).
  </li>
  <li>Fuel Efficiency: The fuel efficiency of the car in liters per 100 
    kilometers (L/100km).</li>
  <li>Weight: The weight of the car in kilograms (kg).</li>
  <li>Price: The price of the car in thousand of euros (EUR).</li>
</ul>

<p>The cars dataset was created to allow for some interesting observations. For 
example, cars with lower speeds tend to have lesser fuel efficiency and lower 
prices. Conversely, cars with higher speeds tend to be lighter, more expensive, 
and more fuel-efficient.</p>
