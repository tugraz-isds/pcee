<h2>The Household Finances Dataset</h2>

<p>
The houshold finances dataset was created to get familiar with parallel 
coordinates and to experiment with them. In the table below, you can add or 
remove columns and rows as well as modify the values. It also allows you to 
explore the interactivity in the chart described in the section “Interactive 
Data Exploration”, helping you practice how to work with the chart 
interactively.
