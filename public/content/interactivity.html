<h2>Interactive Data Exploration</h2>

<p>
A static parallel coordinates plot provides an overview of the entire
dataset, but only interactivity really brings it to life. Numerous
interaction techniques help an analyst explore a multidimensional
dataset and find relevant insights. Some interaction techniques relate
to dimensions (variables) of the data: showing and hiding dimensions,
adjusting a dimension’s range, moving dimensions, and inverting
dimensions, as well as displaying histograms. Others relate to records
(data points): selecting, brushing and linking, filtering, and
hovering over records.
</p>


<h3>Inverting Dimensions</h3>

<p>
By default, a dimension’s axis places higher values at the top and lower 
values at the bottom. Inverting a dimension can be helpful to corroborate a 
suspected correlation between adjacent dimensions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking the arrow above the dimension axis.</li>
<li>Right-clicking the dimension name to activate the context menu and 
  selecting <span class="uiname">Invert</span>.</li>
</ul>



<p>

<span class="header">Moving Dimensions</span><br><br>

When looking for correlations between dimensions, meaningful relationships 
are only revealed between adjacent dimensions. Hence, it is important to be 
able to move one dimension next to another dimension of interest. <br><br>

<span class="option-header">Option to Move a Dimension in the Chart:</span><br>
<p class="options-header"></p>
<p>With drag and drop a dimension can be moved at the desired position.</p>

<p>

<span class="header">Hiding Dimensions</span><br><br>

Displaying too many dimensions can be overwhelming, so it is important to 
be able to hide individual dimensions.<br><br>

<span class="option-header">Option to Hide a Dimension in the Chart:</span><br>

<ul>
    <li>A dimension can hidden by right-clicking the dimension name to activate 
        the context menu and selecting <span class="italic">Hide</span>.</li>
    <li>Hidden dimensions can be shown from every dimensions context menu,
        by clicking on <span class="italic">Show All</span>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

<span class="header">Adjusting a Dimension's Range</span><br><br>

By default, the range of the dimension’s axis is set to the rounded minimum 
and rounded maximum values present in the current dataset.<br><br> 

<span class="option-header">Options to Set Dimensions Range in the Chart:
    </span><br>

Adjust the range of a dimension from its context menu, where three options 
are available:<br>

<ul>
    <li>By clicking <span class="italic">Set Range</span> to set the range to 
        specific values.</li>
    <li>By clicking <span class="italic">Set Range from Data</span> to set the 
        dimension to the original
        range.</li>
    <li>By clicking <span class="italic">Set Rounded Range from Data</span> to 
        reset the dimension to the
        rounded values.</li>
</ul>

<p>

<span class="header">Filter Records</span><br><br>

Records can be activated and deactivated by setting filters on one or more 
dimensions. Records outside of the range are automatically deactivated and 
greyed out.<br><br>

<span class="option-header">Options to Filter Records in the Chart:</span>

<ul>
    <li>A double-edged range slider can be manipulated on every dimension to 
        filter out records by values on that dimension.</li>
    <li>Set and reset filters from the dimension’s context menu. With <span class="italic">Set Filter</span> a filter to specific values can be set and by clicking <span class="italic">Reset Filter</span> the filter gets reseted to include all records.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    
<span class="header">Selecting Records</span><br><br>

It is helpful to be able to select one or more records in the dataset and 
to highlight them accordingly.<br><br>

<span class="option-header">Options to Select Records in the Chart:</span>

<ul>
    <li>Left-clicking one or more polylines selects the corresponding record(s) 
        and highlights them in orange.</li>
    <li>Shift-left-clicking adds one or more records to the current selection. 
    </li>
    <li>Control-left-clicking toggles the selection status of the corresponding 
        records.</li>
    <li>Select, unselect records from a records context menu.</li>
    <li>Left-clicking in empty space clears the current selection. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

<span class="header">Hovering over Records</span><br><br>

If there are a large number of records, a parallel coordinates visualisation 
contains a large number of potentially crossing and overlapping polylines, so 
it is challenging to recognise which polyline belongs to which record.<br><br>

<span class="option-header">Option to Hover over Records in the Chart:</span><br>
<p class="options-header"></p>
<p>
Hovering over one or more polylines highlights the polyline(s) beneath the 
mouse pointer in red and displays tooltips with the labels and values of the 
corresponding records.</p>
