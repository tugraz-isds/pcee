<p>A static parallel coordinates plot provides an overview of the entire 
dataset, but only interactivity really brings it to life. Numerous interaction 
techniques help an analyst explore a multidimensional dataset and find relevant 
insights. Some interaction techniques relate to dimensions (variables) of the 
data: showing and hiding dimensions, adjusting a dimension’s range, moving 
dimensions, and inverting dimensions, as well as displaying histograms. Others 
relate to records (data points): selecting, brushing and linking, filtering, 
and hovering over records.</p>

<h4>Exploring Available Interactions in Charts</h4>

<p id="invert"><b>Inverting Dimensions:</b> 
By default, a dimension’s axis places higher values at the top and lower 
values at the bottom. A dimension can be inverted either by clicking the 
arrow above the dimension axis or by right-clicking the dimension name to 
activate the context menu and selecting Invert. Inverting a dimension can 
be helpful to corroborate a suspected correlation between adjacent dimensions.

<p id="move"><b>Moving Dimensions:</b> 
When looking for correlations between dimensions, meaningful relationships 
are only revealed between adjacent dimensions. Hence, it is important to be 
able to move one dimension next to another dimension of interest. With drag and 
drop a dimension can be moved at the desired position.</p>

<p id="hide"><b>Hiding Dimensions:</b> 
Displaying too many dimensions can be overwhelming, so it is important to 
be able to hide individual dimensions. A dimension can hidden by 
right-clicking the dimension name to activate the context menu and 
selecting <i>Hide</i>.</p>

<p id="range"><b>Adjusting a Dimension's Range:</b> 
By default, the range of the dimension’s axis is set to the rounded minimum 
and rounded maximum values present in the current dataset. The user can 
adjust the range of a dimension from its context menu, where three options 
are available: <i>Set Range</i> to set the range to specific values,  
<i>Set Range from Data</i> to set the dimension to the original range
and <i>Set Rounded Range from Data</i> to reset the dimension to the
rounded values.</p>

<p id="filter"><b>Filter Records:</b> 
Records can be activated and deactivated by setting filters on one or more 
dimensions. A double-edged range slider can be manipulated on every 
dimension to filter out records by values on that dimension. Records 
outside of the range are automatically deactivated and greyed out. A 
further option is to set and reset filters from a dimension’s context menu: 
<i>Set Filter</i> sets a filter to specific values and <i>Reset Filter</i> 
reset the filter to include all records.</div>

<p><b>Hovering over Records:</b> 
If there are a large number of records, a parallel coordinates visualisation 
contains a large number of potentially crossing and overlapping polylines, so 
it is challenging to recognise which polyline belongs to which record. Hovering 
over one or more polylines highlights the polyline(s) beneath the mouse pointer 
in red and displays tooltips with the labels and values of the corresponding 
records.</p>

<p id="select"><b>Selecting Records:</b> 
It is helpful to be able to select one or more records in the dataset and 
to highlight them accordingly. Left-clicking one or more polylines selects 
the corresponding record(s) and highlights them in orange. 
Shift-left-clicking adds one or more records to the current selection. 
Control-left-clicking toggles the selection status of the corresponding 
records. Left-clicking in empty space clears the current selection. A 
further option is to select, unselect records from a records context menu.
