<h2>Student Marks Dataset</h2>

<p class="step" data-step="2">
A fictitious dataset of student marks consists of a header row, 30 rows of data 
(records), and 9 columns (dimensions), including the name of the student.
The dataset was deliberately curated to contain interesting patterns and 
relationships. Each row represents one student and their marks in 8 subjects. 
Each dimension, apart from the first, represents one subject.
