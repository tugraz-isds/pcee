<p>Multidimensional data refers to data that is organised in multiple 
dimensions, allowing it to be analysed from various perspectives. Each 
dimension represents a different attribute or feature of the data, such as 
time, location, or category.</p>

<p>Multidimensional datasets are typically stored in tabular form, like a 
spreadsheet, with a number of columns (dimensions or variables) and rows 
(records or data points). Large multidimensional datasets can have hundreds of 
dimensions and thousands of records.</p>

<p>In the current parallel coordinates plot, a dataset with 5 dimensions and 6 
records, representing different cars with varying specifications, is 
visualised.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Speed:</b> The maximum speed of the car in kilometers per hour (km/h).</li>
  <li><b>Fuel Efficiency:</b> The fuel efficiency of the car in liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km).</li>
  <li><b>Weight:</b> The weight of the car in kilograms (kg).</li>
  <li><b>Price:</b> The price of the car in thousand of euros (EUR).</li>
