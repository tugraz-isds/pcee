<h2>Interactive Operations</h2>

<p>
Interactivity brings a parallel coordinates chart to life.
Some interaction techniques relate to records: selecting, filtering, and 
hovering over records.
Others relate to dimensions of the data: showing and hiding dimensions, 
adjusting a dimensionâ€™s range, moving dimensions, and inverting
dimensions.
