<h2>4. Operations on Dimensions</h2>

<p>
Other interactive operations relate to dimensions of the data:
</p>
<ul>

<li><span class="liheading">Inverting Dimensions</span>
<p class="litext">
By default, a dimension’s axis places higher values at the top and lower 
values at the bottom. Inverting a dimension can be helpful to corroborate a 
suspected correlation between adjacent dimensions.
</p>

<p class="liinstruction">Click the arrow above the dimension axis or 
use the dimension's context menu to invert the dimension.</p>
</li>
<li><span class="liheading">Moving Dimensions</span>
<p class="litext">
When looking for correlations between dimensions, meaningful relationships 
are only revealed between adjacent dimensions. Hence, it is important to be 
able to move one dimension next to another dimension of interest.
</p>

<p class="liinstruction">Use drag and drop to move a dimension to the 
desired position.</p>
</li>
<li><span class="liheading">Hiding Dimensions</span>

<p class="litext">
Displaying too many dimensions can be overwhelming, so it is important to 
be able to hide individual dimensions.
</p>

<p class="liinstruction">Hide dimensions from a dimension's context menu. Use Show All to restore all.</p>
</li>
<li><span class="liheading">Adjusting a Dimension's Range</span>

<p class="litext">
By default, the range of the dimension’s axis is set to the minimum 
and maximum values present in the current dataset.
</p>

<p class="liinstruction">Adjust the range of a dimension from a dimension's context menu.</p>
</li>
</ul>
