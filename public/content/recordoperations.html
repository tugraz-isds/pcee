<h2>Operations on Records</h2>

<ul>

<li><span class="liheading">Filtering Records</span>
<p class="litext">
Records can be activated and deactivated by setting filters on one or more 
dimensions. Records outside of the range are automatically deactivated and 
greyed out.
</p>
<p class="liinstruction">Try using one of the double-edged range sliders to
filter out some records. Filters can also be set from a dimension's
context menu.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="liheading">Selecting Records</span>
<p class="litext">It is helpful to be able to select one or more records in the 
dataset and to highlight them accordingly.
</p>
<p class="liinstruction">Left-clicking one or more polylines selects the
corresponding record(s) and highlights them in orange. Left-clicking in empty 
space clears the current selection.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="liheading">Hovering over Records</span>
<p class="litext">
If there are a large number of records, a parallel coordinates visualisation 
contains a large number of potentially crossing and overlapping polylines, so 
it is challenging to recognise which polyline belongs to which record.
</p>
<p class="liinstruction">Hovering over one or more polylines highlights the 
polyline(s) beneath the mouse pointer in red and displays tooltips with the 
labels of the corresponding records.</p>
</li>
