<h2>Operations on Records</h2>

<ul>

<li><span class="liheading">Filtering Records</span></li>

<p class="litext">
Records can be activated and deactivated by setting filters on one or more 
dimensions. Records outside of the range are automatically deactivated and 
greyed out.
</p>

<p class="liuitext">To filter out records a double-edged range slider can be 
manipulated on every dimension. Furthermore filters can be set within the 
dimension's context menu.</p>
    
<li><span class="liheading">Selecting Records</span></li>

<p class="litext">It is helpful to be able to select one or more records in the 
dataset and to highlight them accordingly.
</p>

<p class="liuitext">
Left-clicking one or more polylines selects the corresponding record(s) 
and highlights them in orange. Left-clicking in empty space clears the current 
selection.
</p>

<li><span class="liheading">Hovering over Records</span></li>

<p class="litext">
If there are a large number of records, a parallel coordinates visualisation 
contains a large number of potentially crossing and overlapping polylines, so 
it is challenging to recognise which polyline belongs to which record.
</p>

<p class="liuitext">
Hovering over one or more polylines highlights the polyline(s) beneath the 
mouse pointer in red and displays tooltips with the labels of the 
corresponding records.
