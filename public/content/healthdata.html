<h2>Example Dataset Heart Health</h2>

<p>
A fictitious dataset which represents health-related measurements from six 
patients was created to allow for some interesting observations. It consists of 
a header row, 6 rows of data (records), and 6 columns (dimensions):
<p>
    
<ul>
<li>Patient: Identifier for each patient.</li>
<li>Age: The patient's age.</li>
<li>BloodPressure: Systolic blood pressure reading (mmHg).</li>
<li>HeartRate: Resting heart rate in beats per minute (bpm).</li>
<li>BMI: Body Mass Index (indicator of body fat based on height and weight).
</li>
<li>Cholesterol: Total cholesterol level in the blood (mg/dL).</li>
</ul>
