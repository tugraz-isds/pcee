<p>A dataset which represents health-related measurements from six patients,
intended for use in medical data analysis which consists of 6 dimensions and 6
records:<p>
    
<ul>
  <li>Patient: Identifier for each patient.
  </li>
  <li>Age: The patient's age</li>
  <li>BloodPressure: Systolic blood pressure reading (mmHg).</li>
  <li>HeartRate: Resting heart rate in beats per minute (bpm).</li>
  <li>BMI: Body Mass Index (indicator of body fat based on height and weight).</li>
  <li>Cholesterol: Total cholesterol level in the blood (mg/dL).</li>
</ul>

<p>The heart helth dataset was created to allow for some interesting observations. For example, the first five patients show a gradual increase in age, blood pressure, heart rate, BMI, and cholesterol â€“ consistent with aging and typical risk progression.Patient 6 stands out as a clear outlier.</p>
