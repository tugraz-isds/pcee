<p>Multidimensional data refers to data that is organised in multiple 
dimensions, allowing it to be analysed from various perspectives. Each 
dimension represents a different attribute or feature of the data. Each record 
can be represented as a vector of values across these dimensions.</p>

<p>Multidimensional datasets are typically stored in tabular form, like a 
spreadsheet, with a number of columns (dimensions or variables) and rows 
(records or data points). Large multidimensional datasets can have hundreds of 
dimensions and thousands of records.</p>

<p>Analysing multidimensional data allows us to uncover patterns, 
relationships, and trends between different attributes. Visualising such data 
through techniques like parallel coordinates plots, scatter plots, or heatmaps 
can provide a clearer understanding of how different variables interact and how 
they influence one another.</p>

<p>Visualising multidimensional data through techniques like parallel 
coordinates plots, scatter plots, or heatmaps helps to gain a clearer 
understanding of how different variables interact and influence each other. 
Each of these techniques highlights different aspects of the data, and when 
combined, they allow for a deeper, more comprehensive analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Parallel coordinates plots</strong> are ideal for visualising 
relationships between multiple dimensions simultaneously, especially when you 
want to compare how different records perform across several 
attributes.</p>

<p><strong>Scatter plots</strong> are effective for identifying correlations 
between two variables and spotting any trends or outliers.</p>

<p><strong>Heatmeaps</strong> provide an intuitive way to visualise the density 
and intensity of relationships between multiple variables, which can be useful 
for identifying patterns that may not be immediately obvious.</p>

<p>When used together, these techniques can complement each other by offering 
various perspectives of the same data, making it easier to spot trends, 
correlations, and anomalies that might be overlooked in a single visualisation 
type. By cross-referencing insights from multiple visualisations, you can gain 
a more holistic understanding of the dataset.</p>
