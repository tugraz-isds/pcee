<h2>Multidimensional Data</h2>

<p>
Multidimensional data refers to data that is organised across multiple 
dimensions, allowing it to be analysed from various perspectives. Each 
dimension represents a different attribute or feature of the data. Each record
has a data value on each dimension.
</p>

<p>Analysing multidimensional data enables:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identifying patterns and outliers.</li>
<li>Recognising relationships between different attributes.</li>
<li>Uncovering trends.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Visualising multidimensional data through techniques like parallel 
coordinates plots, scatter plots, or heatmaps helps to gain a clearer 
understanding of how different variables interact and influence each other. 
Each of these techniques highlights different aspects of the data, and when 
combined, they provide a more comprehensive analysis:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Parallel coordinates plots:
<ul>
<li>Ideal for visualising relationships across multiple dimensions simultaneously.</li>
<li>Especially useful for comparing different records across several dimensions.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Scatter plots:
<ul>
<li>Effective for identifying correlations between two variables.</li>
<li>Great for spotting trends and outliers.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Heatmaps:
<ul>
<li>Provide an intuitive way to visualise the density and intensity of relationships between multiple variables.</li>
<li>Useful for identifying patterns that may not be immediately obvious.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>How these techniques work together:</p>
<ul>
<li>When these visualisations are used together, they offer a more versatile 
    analysis of the data.</li>
<li>Each technique highlights different aspects of the data, helping to understand how variables interact with each other.
</li>
<li>By cross-referencing insights from multiple visualisations, a more comprehensive view of the dataset can be obtained.</li>
</ul>
