By default, parallel coordinates implementations typically set the
range for each dimension to match the minimum and maximum values in
the dataset. Here, the Maths dimension ranges from 2 to 98, because
that is the range in the data. In this case, each student is awarded
between 0 and 100 points in each subject, and it makes sense to show
the range of each subject dimension from 0 to 100 to better represent
the original data domain.
