Note that all dimensions in the plot have different ranges. This is 
because, by default, Parallel Coordinates set the viewing range for each 
dimension to match the minimum and maximum values in the dataset. In this case, 
each student is awarded between 0 and 100 points in each subject and it would 
make sense to show the range of each subject dimension from 0 to 100 since that 
would be more consistent and better represent the original data domain.
