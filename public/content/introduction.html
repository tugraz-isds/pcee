<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Parallel coordinates are a powerful visualisation technique used to
explore and analyse multidimensional tabular data. Each dimension
(column) is typically represented as a vertical axis. Each record
(row) is represented as a polyline which touches each axis once.
</p>

<p>
By observing how the polylines cluster across axes, analysts can gain
insights into outliers, patterns, and groupings of records. The visual
pattern between adjacent axes can suggest potential correlations
between dimensions.
