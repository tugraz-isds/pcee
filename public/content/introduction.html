<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Parallel coordinates are a powerful visualisation technique used to analyse
multidimensional data. Unlike traditional plots, which represent data along a 
single axis, parallel coordinates map each data dimension onto parallel 
vertical axes. Each record is represented as a polyline connecting values 
across these axes, allowing for an intuitive comparison of multiple variables 
simultaneously.</p>

<p>Parallel coordinates are especially useful when dealing with
multidimensional datasets, as it helps uncover patterns, correlations, and
outliers that might otherwise be difficult to detect. By observing how 
polylines intersect or cluster across axes, analysts can gain insights into 
relationships between variables and identify trends or anomalies within the 
data.</p>

<p>Parallel coordinates have become an essential tool in data exploration, 
enabling users to better understand complex datasets and make informed 
decisions based on multidimensional information.</p>
