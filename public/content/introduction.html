<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Parallel coordinates are a powerful visualisation technique used to
explore and analyse multidimensional tabular data. Each dimension
(column) is typically represented as a vertical axis. Each record
(row) is represented as a polyline which touches each axis once.

By observing how the polylines cluster across axes, analysts can gain
insights into outliers, trends, and groupings of records. The visual
pattern between adjacent axes can suggest potential correlations
between dimensions.
