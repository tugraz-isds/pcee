# Parallel Coordinates Explorable Explainer (PCEE)

An explorable explainer which guides a reader through an interactive tutorial about parallel coordinates.
This is a single page web application (SPA) built using [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/).

A live version of the latest deployment can be found at
[https://tugraz-isds.github.io/pcee](https://tugraz-isds.github.io/pcee).

## Dependencies

The explorable explainer uses [SPCD3](https://github.com/tugraz-isds/spcd3) to generate and
visualise parallel coordinates.

Scroll-driven animations are implemented using native CSS.
For browsers and platforms that don't yet support it, a fallback is provided
using [GSAP](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP) as a polyfill.
